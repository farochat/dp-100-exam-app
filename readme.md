# About this project


Getting the rifth material to pass a certification could be tiresome. This project is a simple app that allows you to practice your skills in the exam with some questions that i looked for in different platform to face the **DP-100** microsoft certification exam.

# How to use it


Just clone the repository and run the app with streamlit. Of course, you first need to create an enviroment and install the requirements. To do so, the ``pdm.loc`` file will be a great help.

# How to create the questions.json file


The questions.json file is a json file that contains the questions and their options. Of course, you could cuild your own bank of questions by giving the questions the rigth format and the app will use them. For that reason i decide to use the bank of questions directly from the root of the repository. The file is called ``questions.json``.

Each question has its own format and **its own question id**. In case that a question needs to be changed or even deleted, could be easily tracked with the question id.
